                <ul>
                    <li>1912 - Born in London, England</li>
                    <li>1931 - Enters King's College, Cambridge, to study mathematics, demonstrating exceptional brilliance</li>
                    <li>1934 - Graduates with a firs-class degree in mathematics</li>
                    <li>1936 - Publishes his seminal paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," introducing the Turing machine, a theoretical model of computation that laid the foundation for computer science.</li>
                    <li>1937-1938 - Studies at Princeton University, focusing on logic and mathematics.</li>
                    <li>1939 - Returns to England on the eve of World War II.</li>
                    <li>1940 - Joins the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's top-secret codebreaking center.</li>
                    <li>1945 - Works at the National Physical Laboratory, designing the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first electronic computers.</li>
                    <li>1950 - Publishes his landmark paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," introducing the Turing test as a way to assess a machine's intelligence.</li>
                    <li>1952 - Convicted of homosexual acts and chemically castrated as punishment under the harsh laws of the time.</li>
                    <li>1954 - Tragically takes his own life at the age of 41.</li>
